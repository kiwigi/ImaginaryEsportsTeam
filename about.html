        <p class="aboutText">Born on a cold winter night our kitten litter woke up and said "innit bruv". Despite being English they grew up and became pro Valorant players. It all started when the oldest kitten, Tofuzu bought a gaming PC for the pack but abaan, the youngest never got a turn on the PC and he was forced to play on his 30fps Surface. Abaan decided lto leave in search for a new gamer PC. The remaining kittens took turns insulting people on Valorant, But none were as good as SavageFox's little brother who got completely banned from Valorant for going AFK multiple times. He was quite a rascal that one. ( DISCLAIMER: SavageFox's little brother is not associated with TenKittenZ in any way. None of our players have ever gotten banned from Valorant.) Despite Savage Fox dealing with his brother going to Valorant jail, the squad stayed strong. In 2020, Tofuzu and VividEradicator started playing Valorant. This is when Tofuzu (who was bronze at the time) met Abaan, her long lost brother, and recruited him into the team.  The pack was now full again and thatâ€™s when TenkittenZ was born.</p>
