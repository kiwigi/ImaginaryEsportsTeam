        <!-- <div id="valRosTitle"> Our Valorant Roster </div> -->
        <p class="aboutText"> Born on a cold winter night our kitten litter rose up and said "innit bruv". (they were born in England sadly) Despite being English they grew up and became pro Valorant players. (the best in the world uwu) It all started when the oldest kitten, Tofuzu bought a gaming PC for the pack. Then all kittens took turns insulting people on Valorant. But none were as good as SavageFox's little brother who got completly banned from Valorant for going AFK multiple times. He was quite a rascall that one. ( DISCLAIMER: SavageFox's little brother is not associated with TenKittenZ in any way. None of our players have ever gotten banned from Valorant.) Despite Savage Fox dealing with his brother going to Valorant jail, he did not let it get him down. He became one of the greatest Skye mains in the world and gave representation to thousands of furries around the globe. The rest of the pack were not furries (except for VividEradicator, he is also a furry) but they were all very good at Valorant. Tofuzu was the best valorant player in the region of MEOW (Australia is not real, but MEOW is a real region)</p>
